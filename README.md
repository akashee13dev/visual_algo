# Algo Visualizer

This is my personal project to visualize common algorithms, especially graph and pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra’s.  

I am currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to strengthen my problem-solving skills. While exploring various algorithm visualizers online, I decided to build my own from scratch using React. For the UI styling, I referred to several CSS resources on the internet.

This is my first project that I am truly proud to showcase. My plan is to continuously improve it by adding more algorithms one by one and enhancing the visualization experience.

## Features so far

- Grid-based pathfinding visualization
- Support for algorithms like Dijkstra
- Interactive start and end node selection
- Real-time animation of algorithm progress
- Clean, modern UI inspired by Google’s design principles

---

## Future Plans

- Add more algorithms: A*, BFS, DFS, and others
- Improve UI/UX with better animations and responsiveness
- Add explanation and stats for each algorithm run

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `npm install`  
3. Run `npm start`  
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
